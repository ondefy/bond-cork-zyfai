# Operating Cork phoenix/v0.4-rc.1

This skill replaces the retired `cork-operations` skill, whose address book
pointed at deployments that no longer exist. This skill deliberately carries
**no addresses and no API payloads**: the tool surface is self-documenting and
reads live state, so the skill's job is wiring, sequencing, and guardrails.

## Setup

Requires the cork-cli MCP server at the pinned tag **`v0.6.0`**. Install
and MCP registration:
[quickstart §"the integration kit"](https://github.com/Cork-Technology/cork-cli/blob/v0.6.0/docs/zyfai-quickstart.md).
Never treat an address printed in any doc as current, however fresh the
capture; read addresses live.
Self-test: a healthy install answers **exactly 9 tools**. If it doesn't, fix
the install before doing anything else — do not work around a partial surface.

## The tool surface and its trust model

Nine tools; the taxonomy is the trust model:

- `cork_query` — read live chain + venue state. `cork_compute` — deterministic
  math over verified state. `cork_decode` — bytes to labelled JSON.
  `cork_capabilities` — the searchable manual (its doc topics — `signing`,
  `modes`, `units`, `warnings`, `orders`, `generations`, `migration` — carry
  the envelope, unit, order and generation contracts).
  `cork_track` — verify, simulate, reconcile. All read-only.
- `cork_prepare_phoenix` / `cork_prepare_orders` / `cork_prepare_market` —
  build **unsigned** bytes or typed data for later signing. They execute
  nothing.
- `cork_submit` — **the only side-effecting tool.** It relays an
  already-signed payload; it never signs and never holds a key.

Signing and key custody stay in the caller's stack, always.

## Decision rules

1. **Start unfamiliar tasks with `cork_capabilities`.** It is the manual and
   maturity map; discover the right tool rather than guessing one.
2. **Read, never remember.** Addresses, rates, registered assets and recipes
   come from `cork_query` at the moment of use. Anything remembered from a doc,
   a prior session, or this repository's history is presumed stale.
3. **The manifest is the authority on versions.**
   [`phoenix/v0.4-rc.1`](https://github.com/Cork-Technology/distribution/blob/main/distributions/phoenix/v0.4-rc.1.json)
   pins the set. If a tool, doc, or API self-reports something that contradicts
   it, stop and surface the mismatch instead of picking a side silently.
4. **Verify before submit.** Run the `cork_track` verification/simulation on a
   prepared artifact before it is signed, and never call `cork_submit` with a
   payload you did not just verify. Every prepared artifact carries a
   `data.execution` block naming its exact completion path and a
   `data.approvals` list naming every grant it needs (with the unsigned
   approve payloads); the signing guide is `cork_capabilities topic:"signing"`.
   Note `cork_submit` relays venue postings (RFQs, orders) — a *fill* is
   signed and broadcast from the caller's own stack, never through the tool.
5. **A reason code is an answer, not an error.** `unavailable`,
   `pool_not_found`, `roles_not_granted` and similar are documented states —
   report them as findings; do not retry-loop or fabricate the missing result.
6. **Honor the hybrid verification labels.** Venue-backed list reads run in
   `hybrid` mode: each row carries `verification: "confirmed" | "unverified"`,
   and rows the chain refutes are dropped and counted. Prefer confirmed rows;
   treat `unverified` as indeterminate (budget or transport), never as
   chain-confirmed — and never present an unverified row as verified.
7. **Premiums are annualized fractions.** `premiumAnnualized` (decimal-fraction
   string, `"0.041"` = 4.1%) is the one premium field; the tool refuses the
   removed percent `premium` before relay. Do not resurrect the old field from
   memory or history.
8. **Pricing is Zyfai's.** The tooling has no pricing model by design. Premium
   acceptance logic belongs in Zyfai's stack; never derive "a fair premium"
   from the tool and present it as authoritative.
9. **Chain is explicit.** Both chains share addresses; every query and every
   prepared artifact names its chain id. Base (8453) is the default working
   chain for this integration.
10. **Generation is explicit too.** A chain hosts two active generations,
    `phoenix/v0.4-rc.1` (primary) and `phoenix/v0.3-rc.1` (previous). A read of
    an existing pool follows the pool; a prepare targets the primary unless
    `generation` is set (a label, or the alias `previous`). Every result names
    the generation it answered from (`data.generation`); read it before you act.
    `cork_capabilities topic:"generations"` is the contract,
    `topic:"migration"` the exit-and-re-enter recipe.
11. **A ForSelf adapter serves one generation.** Zyfai's deployed adapter is
    bound to the `phoenix/v0.3-rc.1` pool manager. Fill or exercise through it
    only on pools whose `data.generation` is `phoenix/v0.3-rc.1`. For a pool on
    the primary, the tool refuses `adapter_binding_mismatch` and builds nothing;
    report that, do not route around it. A second adapter, bound to the primary,
    is the fix (runbook step 7).
12. **Rank the book for the adapter.** On `cork_query orderbook`, pass the
    adapter as `filters.account`: the ranked view then classifies each row's
    reservation against the address that will call the LOP — the adapter, not
    the Safe — and lists rows the adapter cannot fill under `excluded`.

## Escalation

- Tool or doc contradicts the manifest → report to the humans, cite both.
- Anything that smells like a security issue → security@cork.tech, and stop
  work on the affected path.
- A needed capability is gated or missing → say so plainly; do not emulate it
  with raw RPC calls that bypass the tool's verification.
