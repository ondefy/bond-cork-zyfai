# Zyfai Agent Server

Express server exposing an **ERC-4337 Safe smart wallet** on **Arbitrum One**, controlled by a **shared EOA** and sponsored by **Pimlico** (paymaster). This is the Zyfai side of the `bond.credit × Cork × Zyfai` hackathon pilot at Arbitrum Open House London.

For the full project context (what the three teams are building together and how the pieces fit), see [`PROJECT.md`](../PROJECT.md).

---

## What this server does

- Instantiates a **Safe 4337 smart account** (v1.4.1, EntryPoint v0.7) owned by a single EOA loaded from env
- Exposes a **generic HTTP API** so any teammate (bond.credit keeper, Cork market service) can:
  - Read the smart wallet address (to whitelist it on their side)
  - Send arbitrary batched calls from the smart wallet
- All userOps are **gas-sponsored by Pimlico** — the smart wallet never needs to hold ETH

The smart account is intentionally minimal: the shared EOA is the sole owner and signs every userOp. No Rhinestone attesters, no OwnableValidator module, no session keys.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+**
- A **Pimlico API key** (with credits on Arbitrum One)
- An **Arbitrum One RPC endpoint** (Alchemy, Infura, etc.)
- A **32-byte EOA private key** that will be shared with your teammates

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure env
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and fill:
#   - SHARED_EOA_PRIVATE_KEY
#   - PIMLICO_API_KEY
#   - ALCHEMY_RPC_URL

# 3. Run the dev server (watch mode)
npm run dev
```

On startup, the server logs the smart wallet address so you can share it with bond and Cork immediately:

```
Smart wallet initialized
  smartWalletAddress: 0xabc...
  ownerAddress: 0xdef...
  chainId: 42161
  chainName: Arbitrum One
  isDeployed: false
Zyfai agent server listening on http://localhost:3000
```

`isDeployed: false` is expected before the first tx — the address is deterministic and known in advance thanks to the CREATE2 factory. The smart wallet gets deployed automatically on the first userOp (or you can pre-deploy it manually).

---

## API

All endpoints return JSON. There is **no authentication** — the server is meant to run on a private/trusted network for the hackathon.

### `GET /health`

Health probe.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

```json
{ "status": "ok", "uptime": 12.34, "timestamp": "2026-07-10T06:00:00.000Z" }
```

### `GET /wallet`

Returns the smart wallet address and its current on-chain state.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/wallet
```

```json
{
  "smartWalletAddress": "0xabc...",
  "ownerAddress": "0xdef...",
  "chainId": 42161,
  "chainName": "Arbitrum One",
  "isDeployed": false
}
```

### `POST /tx`

Sends a batch of calls from the smart wallet. Sponsored by Pimlico.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "calls": [
    { "to": "0x...", "value": "0", "data": "0x..." },
    { "to": "0x...", "data": "0x..." }
  ],
  "waitForReceipt": true
}
```

- `calls[].to` — target contract (0x-prefixed 20-byte address, required)
- `calls[].value` — wei amount as string or number (optional, default `0`)
- `calls[].data` — calldata as 0x-prefixed hex (optional, default `0x`)
- `waitForReceipt` — if `true`, waits for the userOp to be included on-chain before responding (optional, default `false`)

**Response (waitForReceipt = false):**

```json
{ "userOpHash": "0x..." }
```

**Response (waitForReceipt = true):**

```json
{
  "userOpHash": "0x...",
  "receipt": {
    "transactionHash": "0x...",
    "blockNumber": "123456789",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

**Example — self-call with empty data (cheap way to force deployment):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tx \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "calls": [{ "to": "0xYOUR_SMART_WALLET", "value": "0", "data": "0x" }],
    "waitForReceipt": true
  }'
```

## Security notes (read before running in any shared environment)

- `SHARED_EOA_PRIVATE_KEY` is a **hackathon-only** key. It's shared across the bond / Cork / Zyfai teams. Do **not** reuse it for any production or personal wallet.
- There is **no HTTP auth** on the API. Do **not** expose the server publicly without adding auth (or restricting network access via firewall / tunnel).
- Rotate the key immediately after the hackathon.
- The smart wallet's on-chain owner is the EOA above. Anyone with the key can move funds out of the smart wallet through any signer.

## Cork cover operations (Base)

Zyfai buys cST cover through its own `CorkForSelfAdapter` — a receiver-forcing wrapper
deployed under Zyfai's name. Raw `CorkPoolManager` and raw 1inch LOP are **never** whitelisted
in the TargetRegistry; the adapter is the only spender the Safe ever approves.

### Deployed adapter (Base, chainId 8453)

Source of truth for every whitelist entry: [`src/generated/cork-selectors.json`](src/generated/cork-selectors.json).
The JSON is auto-extracted from the adapter ABI post-deploy — never hand-edit selector values.

- Address: `0x4C0458cB8dcd2B9c7BDA45E4d59a3060dce59E5E`
- CREATE2 salt: `keccak256("zyfai:CorkForSelfAdapter:v1")` — same address available on Arbitrum One if redeployed with identical params
- Verified: [Basescan](https://basescan.org/address/0x4c0458cb8dcd2b9c7bda45e4d59a3060dce59e5e#code)
- Source: [`Cork-Technology/cork-periphery@v0.1.1`](https://github.com/Cork-Technology/cork-periphery/tree/v0.1.1)
- Generation: bound to the **`phoenix/v0.3-rc.1`** pool manager (`CORK()`). It serves every
  market on that generation and none on `phoenix/v0.4-rc.1`; `ch` refuses the pairing
  (`adapter_binding_mismatch`). Markets on the new generation need a second adapter — same
  source, new constructor arguments — whitelisted beside this one. See
  [`INTEGRATION.md`](../INTEGRATION.md), "Two generations, one adapter each".

### TargetRegistry entries required to BUY cover

Two entries — no more:

| # | target | selector | function | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `0x4C0458cB8dcd2B9c7BDA45E4d59a3060dce59E5E` (adapter) | `0xa9aa7877` | `fillOrderForSelf` | route the 1inch fill through the adapter |
| 2 | `<CA-token-address>` (e.g. sUSDe on the pilot pair) | `0x095ea7b3` | `approve(spender=<adapter>, amount)` | let the adapter pull the CA premium |

If the TargetRegistry constrains `approve` spender: pin `spender = 0x4C04…9E5E` explicitly.

To add these, call `TargetRegistry.whitelist(target, selector)` from the Safe's owner EOA
(this is an **owner** operation, not a session-key op — the session key cannot whitelist itself).

### Exercise entries (add before the first exercise, not needed for buy)

Documented in [`cork-selectors.json`](src/generated/cork-selectors.json) under
`targetRegistryWhitelist.exercise`: `exerciseForSelf` (`0x1ec95fe9`), `exerciseOtherForSelf`
(`0xb29152a5`), `(REF, approve→adapter)`, `(cST, approve→adapter)`. **Never** approve cST to
the raw pool manager — the transfer path bypasses the allowance and the approval sits as
standing risk.

Note: cST/cPT are per-market; every new pool mints new share tokens. One approve-spender
allowlist entry per market you cover.

### Buy flow (once whitelisted + funded)

```bash
# 1. Fund the Safe with the CA premium (~5-20 CA base units for the pilot)
# 2. Dry-run: prepare + simulate but do not broadcast
npm run buy:cover -- --pool-id 0x… --amount <cST-base-units> --dry-run
# 3. Live: broadcast through GUARD_MODULE.executeGuardedBatch
npm run buy:cover -- --pool-id 0x… --amount <cST-base-units>
```

The script walks: `orderbook (ranked for the adapter) → decode order → prepare(--for-self) →
batch pre-flight (eth_call of approvals + fill; the artifact-only simulate is advisory) →
sendGuardedBatch → reconcile`. Bit-invalidator and decaying-auction are warned in-line; a row
reserved for another fill sender never reaches the script. See
[`src/scripts/buy-cover.ts`](src/scripts/buy-cover.ts).

### Discovery — what's registered on Cork today

```bash
npm run discover:cork              # Base by default
npm run discover:cork -- --chain-id 42161   # Arbitrum
```

Prints live protocol deployment (`ch query protocol-config`), registered assets, and
approved recipes. Never hardcodes an address — everything read live.
